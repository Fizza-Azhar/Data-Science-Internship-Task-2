# üìä Task 2: Developer Hub - Data Science & ML Projects

This repository contains three practical machine learning and data science projects:

1. **Bank Marketing Prediction**
2. **Household Energy Consumption Forecasting**
3. **Mall Customer Segmentation**

Each project involves end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

## 1. üìà Bank Marketing Prediction

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using bank marketing data.

**Files:**  
- `Bank_marketing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete ML pipeline.
- `bank.xls`: Dataset used in the project.
- `confusion_matrices.png` & `roc_curve.png`: Model evaluation visualizations.

**Key Steps:**
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest models
- Evaluation via Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC

**To Run:**
```bash
jupyter notebook Bank_marketing.ipynb
```

## 2. ‚ö° Household Energy Consumption Forecasting

**Objective:**  
Forecast short-term energy usage using time-based features.

**Files:**
- `forecast_energy.py`: Python script with feature engineering and forecasting models.
- `household_power_consumption.txt`: Dataset (time series of household energy usage).
- `energy_forecast_comparison.png`: Forecast vs. actual plot.

**Models Used:**
- ARIMA
- NeuralProphet
- XGBoost

**To Run:**
```bash
python forecast_energy.py
```

## 3. üõçÔ∏è Mall Customer Segmentation

**Objective:**  
Cluster mall customers into distinct segments based on spending behavior.

**Files:**
- `mall_customer.ipynb`: Complete notebook using KMeans clustering.
- `Mall_Customers.xls`: Dataset of customer demographics and spending.

**Key Concepts:**
- Elbow method to determine optimal `k`
- PCA/t-SNE for visualization
- Customer segmentation for marketing strategies

**To Run:**
```bash
jupyter notebook mall_customer.ipynb
```
